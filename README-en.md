ðŸ“š Studying **Multiplatform Software Development** at FATEC (Faculty of Technology of the State of SÃ£o Paulo).

ðŸ’¼  I'm currently moving from technical support area to the programming, looking for internship opportunities and/or participation in challenging projects to become a great Software Developer.

ðŸš€ In my last academic project I worked on the development of [**NutriMe**](https://github.com/crewTech-ABP), a web application that keeps track of the food consumed daily by users for calorie and nutrient control.

## **About me:**
* Lover of technology;
* I like helping other people and learning from them;
* In my free time I like to play games and go out with friends/family.
